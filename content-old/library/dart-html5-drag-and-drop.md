    I've given up on HTML5 Drag and Drop (and you should too)! You can read the details about <a href="/blog/drag-and-drop-without-html5" class="alert-link">why I decided against HTML5 Drag and Drop.</a>
  </p>
</div>

The Dart HTML5 Drag and Drop library was created to use HTML5 Drag and Drop in a consistend way across all modern browsers.

The result wasn't all too bad and it did actually work quite well. I received feedback of people using it, some created issues and some even contributed bug fixes (see [source on GitHub](https://github.com/marcojakob/dart-html5-dnd)).

But there were some problems that just couldn't be solved. And with all the strange and changing browser quirks it was just a pain to maintain.

So I [decided to give up](/blog/drag-and-drop-without-html5/) and start from scratch without HTML5.

I've created a new [Dart drag and drop library](/library/dart-drag-and-drop/) - just without the HTML5 - and it's much better!
