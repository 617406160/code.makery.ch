> `GreenfootKara` is a visual and interactive introduction to programming based on the [Greenfoot IDE](http://www.greenfoot.org). It combines the proven concept of the mini-world `Kara` with `Greenfoot`'s flexibility and ease of use.

*Note: If you prefer to work with a professional IDE like **Eclipse or NetBeans** instead of Greenfoot, take a look at [GameGridKara](/library/gamegrid-kara/).*


## Greenfoot

[Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org) is a simple development environment for Java. It allows very rapid development of interactive, graphical projects.

If you're a teacher you can provide Greenfoot scenarios at any level of difficulty for your students. `GreenfootKara` contains many such scenarios with the ladybug Kara.

Greenfoot is great for novice programmers because one doesn't have to deal with many of the difficulties when starting to program (like `public static void main(String [])` and friends). Nevertheless, Greenfoot is real Java and leaves all options open. Thus, advanced students can also implement very complex projects.


## Kara

Kara is a ladybug that lives in a simple world with trees, leafs and mushrooms.

![Kara](/assets/library/greenfoot-kara/kara.png) ![Mushroom](/assets/library/greenfoot-kara/mushroom.png) ![Leaf](/assets/library/greenfoot-kara/leaf.png) ![Tree](/assets/library/greenfoot-kara/tree.png)

The rules of Kara's world are simple:


### Kara's Actions

* Kara can move around with `move()` (Kara can push a mushroom, can step on leafs but can't walk through trees)
* Kara turns left or right with `turnLeft()` or `turnRight()`
* Kara puts down a leaf with `putLeaf()`
* Kara picks up a leaf with `removeLeaf()`


### Kara's Sensors

* Kara checks if he stands on a leaf with `onLeaf()`
* Kara checks if there is a tree with `treeFront()`, `treeLeft()`, or `treeRight()`
* Kara checks if there is a mushroom in front with `mushroomFront()`

## Get Started

Download and install [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org/download). After the installation you should be able to open and compile the predefined Kara scenarios (see downloads on the following pages).

To jump right in go to [Chapter 1: First Steps](/library/greenfoot-kara/chapter1/).

To get more background about `GreenfootKara` and its design decisions visit [Background Info](/library/greenfoot-kara/background/) (is especially recommmended for teachers).
